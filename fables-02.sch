There once was a fat bull.  The bull was grazing in a meadow.  

A lion watched the bull and salivated because the lion wanted to eat the bull.  

The lion didn't attack the bull because the lion feared sharp every horn of the bull.  

The lion began to be hungry and decided to attempt to kill the bull.  

The lion planned to trick the bull because the lion wasn't able to fight the bull.  

The lion walked toward the bull and began to feign that the lion was friendly.  

The lion said to the bull that the lion admired the body of the bull, admired the head of the bull, he admired every shoulder of the bull and admired every thigh of the bull.  

The lion advised the bull to remove every horn of the bull because every horn of the bull was ugly.  

The lion succeeded in persuading the bull to remove every horn of the bull.  

The lion ate the bull, and the bull began to be defenseless.
