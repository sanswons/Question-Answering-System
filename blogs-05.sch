There once was a group of students and a narrator.  The narrator was a teacher, owned some white slip and owned a desk.  The narrator was teaching the group of students language.  

The narrator checked the group of students for presence and stood at the front of a classroom.  

The slip fell because the not-functional elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.  

The group of students saw that the slip had fallen because the elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.  

The narrator noticed that the ankle of the narrator was observed.  

The narrator nervously looked toward the ankle of the narrator and observed that the slip had fallen because the elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.  

The narrator glanced around the group of students.  

The narrator carefully stepped over the slip.  

The narrator feigned bewilderment.  

The narrator lifted the slip and inserted it into a bottom drawer of the desk.  

The narrator resumed teaching, and the group of students didn't react.  

The narrator later feared for the group of students to tell a parent of the group of students that the group of students had seen that the slip had fallen because the elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.
