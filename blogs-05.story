Just thought I would share with you one of my most embarassing moments as a teacher to date. Ten years ago I was teaching a mixed class of 5th graders ESL. I had taken the register and was standing at the front of the class doing some revision... However, all eyes were not on my face but at my ankles. Nervously I looked down to see that my underslip had somehow made its way to the floor. Elastic gone What to do? So I looked at my underwear round my ankles, looked at the class, looked back at the garment, carefully stepped out of it, said, "Oh dear look, what on earth can that be?", lifted the offending white (not red and black thank the Lord) slip and casually popped it in the bottom drawer of my desk. I continued, "Ok class, page 33." No one, strangely, batted an eyelid. Later that day I wondered how they had described the day to their parents over dinner. "So Ahmed, what did you do in school today?" "We looked at the teacher's underwear."
