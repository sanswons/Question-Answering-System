A narrator recently and momentarily opened the door of the patio of the narrator.  

A group of bugs entered the apartment of the narrator.  

The narrator didn't initially notice that the group of bugs had entered the apartment of the narrator.  

The narrator slept.  

The narrator awaked overnight and saw the group of bugs being on the ceiling of the apartment of the narrator.  

The group of bugs began to be the enemy of the narrator, and the narrator grabbed a reachable and close thing that was a rolled comic book because the group of bugs scared her.  

The narrator began to hit the group of bugs with the comic book.  

The narrator smeared the greasy innards of the group of bugs and managed to kill every bug who wasn't the big fatty of the group of bugs who was more large than every bug.  

The narrator grazed the fatty of the group of bugs with the comic book and removed a limb of the fatty of the group of bugs.  

The narrator stopped hitting the group of bugs, and the fatty of the group of bugs began to be a three-legged insect and escaped her.  

The fatty of the group of bugs began to now lurk in the apartment of the narrator and undoubtedly wanted to retaliate against the narrator.  

The narrator began to look around every corner of the apartment of the narrator, began to check the toilet seat of the narrator for the fatty of the group of bugs in order for she to sit down on the toilet seat of the narrator and she in due course expected for the fatty of the group of bugs to jump toward her.  

Every action of the story of the narrator happened notably, and a group of cicadas didn't even and yet arrive to the apartment of the narrator.
