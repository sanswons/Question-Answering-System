Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again.
