There once was a crow.  The crow was sitting on a branch of a tree.  Some cheese was in the beak of the crow.  

A fox observed the crow and tried to discover how to get the cheese.  

The fox came and stood under the tree.  

The fox looked toward the crow and said that he saw a noble bird who was above him.  

The fox said that the beauty of the bird was incomparable.  

The fox said that the hue of the plumage of the bird was exquisite.  

The fox said that -- if the sweetness of the voice of the bird is equal to the fairness of the appearance of the bird -- the bird would be undoubtedly the queen of every bird.  

The crow felt that the fox had flattered her and cawed loudly in order for she to show him that she was able to sing.  

The cheese fell.  

The fox snatched the cheese, said that the crow was able to sing and the fox said that the crow needed wits.
