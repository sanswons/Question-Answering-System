Bug out for blood the other night, I left the patio door open just long enough to let in a dozen bugs of various size. I didn't notice them until the middle of the night, when I saw them clinging to the ceiling. Since I'm such a bugaphobe, I grabbed the closest object within reach, and with a rolled-up comic book I smote mine enemies and smeared their greasy bug guts. All except for the biggest one.  I only clipped that one, taking off one of its limbs. So now there's a five-limbed insect lurking in the apartment, no doubt looking for some vengeance against me. I'm looking around corners, checking the toilet before sitting down, wondering when it's going to jump out. All this, and the cicadas haven't even arrived yet.
